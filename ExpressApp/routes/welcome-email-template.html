    Dear {{ name }},
  </p>

  <p>
    Thanks for enrolling as a member at Ithaca Generator! You’ll want to save this email -
    it has a lot of important information.
    Here are some next steps to get you started on the path to getting the most
    out of your membership, and contributing to our awesome community.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h3>Registering for Key Access</h3>
  <p>
    Ithaca Generator uses key vaults for membership access! Read below for how to set up your access to IG East and West.
    All members all IG members have access to the both locations from 12pm to 8pm daily, and Extra members have 24/7 access.
  </p>
  <p>
    You’ll need a phone or tablet able to run the Master Lock Vault Enterprise app to unlock the key vaults.
    The app normally connects to the vaults via Bluetooth, but it can also generate a temporary PIN code you can use as an alternative.
    If you don’t have a smartphone, please respond to this message or reach out to board@ithacagenerator.org and we’ll work with you to find a solution.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Fill out the IG Access Registration Form <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsIqj4tLeEIPyq_bd9LazAHJAp52x73wfe1jLY7JFLMjoOSQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">HERE</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Within a day or two, we’ll get you set up and you’ll receive an email with the subject Welcome to Master Lock® Vault. This will contain the organization ID and a temporary password you’ll need below.
    </li>
    <li>
      Download the Master Lock Vault Enterprise app for your phone or tablet. [You need the blue Enterprise version of the app, not the similar orange Home version].
      <ol>
        <li>
          Register with the email address you provided in step one, and information you received from Master Lock via email.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go to Settings and deselect "Always Connect to Locks."
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Using the Key Vaults:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Open the app on your phone.
      <ol>
        <li>
          You should see two locks, labeled IG East and IG West
        </li>
        <li>
          Outside of your access hours there will be a red icon to the right.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Press the on button on the vault to wake it up.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the app you should now see a blue unlock button.
    </li>
    <li>
      Press the unlock button for that lock in the app.
    </li>
    <li>
      The cancel button on the vault will turn green and you can open the vault.
    </li>
    <li>
      Unlock the door, and immediately replace the key in the vault.
    </li>
    <li>
      Important: Wait a few seconds and try to open it again to make sure it is locked. If it doesn't lock, press the button to wake it up and then open and close the door.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Please replace the key in the vault immediately after using it. Please don’t set it down or put it in your pocket, even for a second. It’s just too easy to forget.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the key is missing, ask anyone who is present if they have it.
    If not, immediately email ithaca_hackerspace@googlegroups.com
    to let everyone know. Hopefully someone will realize they have it and bring it back.
    If the key is found, please email the list again to let everyone know.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please reply to this message or email board@ithacagenerator.org with any questions or concerns about access to IG East and West.

  <h3>Storage</h3>

  <p>
    Currently, members are not permitted to store personal materials at the space, as we are transitioning to paid membership storage.
    However, anyone wanting to temporarily house a project they’re working on should email board@ithacagenerator.org ahead of time to put in a request.
    This will help us ensure our spaces remain usable by all our members.
