  <p>
  ACKNOWLEDGE, agree, and represent that I understand the nature of Ithaca Generatorâ€™s activities and that I
  am sober, qualified, in good health, and in proper physical and mental condition to participate in such Activity.
  I further agree and warrant that if at any time I believe conditions to be unsafe, I will immediately discontinue
  further participation in the Activity.
  </p>  
  
  <p>
  FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT: (a) THESE ACTIVITIES MAY INVOLVE RISKS AND DANGERS OF SERIOUS BODILY
  INJURY, INCLUDING PERMANENT DISABILITY, AND DEATH ("RISKS'); (b) these Risks and dangers may be
  caused by my own action or inaction, the action or inaction of others participating in the Activity, the condition
  in which the Activity takes place, or the NEGLIGENCE OF THE "RELEASEES" NAMED BELOW; (c) there may be
  OTHER RISK AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC LOSSES either not known to me or not readily foreseeable at this
  time; and I FULLY ACCEPT AND ASSUME ALL SUCH RISKS AND ALL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR LOSSES, COSTS,
  AND DAMAGES I incur as a result of my participation or that of the minor in the Activity.

  ON MY ACCOUNT CAUSED OR ALLEGED TO BE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE
  OF THE "RELEASEES" OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING NEGLIGENT RESCUE OPERATIONS AND I FURTHER
  AGREE that if, despite this RELEASE AND WAIVER OF LIABILITY, ASSUMPTION OF RISK, AND INDEMNITY
  AGREEMENT I, or anyone on my behalf, makes a claim against any of the Releasees, I WILL INDEMNIFY, SAVE,
  AND HOLD HARMLESS EACH OF THE RELEASEES from any litigation expenses, attorney fees, loss, liability,
  damage, or cost which may incur as the result of such claim.
  </p>

  <p>
  I HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, FULLY UNDERSTAND ITS TERMS, UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE GIVEN
  UP SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS BY SIGNING IT AND HAVE SIGNED IT FREELY AND WITHOUT INDUCEMENT OR
  ASSURANCE OF ANY NATURE AND INTEND IT TO BE A COMPLETE AND UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE OF
